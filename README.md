# Checked C
Checked C is an extension to C that adds static and dynamic checking to detect or prevent common programming
errors such as buffer overruns, out-of-bounds memory accesses, and incorrect type casts.   This repo contains the
specification for the extension, test code, and samples. For the latest PDF version of the specification and the 
draft of the next PDF version, see the [Checked C releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/releases).

We are creating a modified version of the LLVM/clang compiler that supports
Checked C.  For more information on the compiler, see the
[Checked C clang repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang).
Pre-built compilers are available on the Checked C clang 
[releases page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/releases), if you want to
try out the extension while it is being implemented.
