\chapter{Bounds for pointer referents that are \arrayptr\ types}
\label{bounds-for-pointer-referents-that-are-arrayux5fptr-types}

\emph{\texttt{Under construction -- do not bother reading this yet.}}

A program may have pointers to \arrayptr s. These pointers will be the
addresses of locations that contain \arrayptr\ s. The \arrayptr\ values
stored in those location must have bounds declared in order to be used
to access memory.

Here are some examples of variable declarations of pointers to
\arrayptr s:
\begin{verbatim}
array_ptr<array_ptr<int>> x;
ptr<array_ptr<int>> y;
\end{verbatim}

The \arrayptr\ values stored at that location must have bounds
declared in order to be used to access to memory. The pointer itself may
be a \ptr\ or an \arrayptr.

We will use the terminology `pointer referent' to describe the value
stored at an address given a pointer.
