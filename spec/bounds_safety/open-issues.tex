\chapter{Pending work and open issues}
\label{chapter:open-issues}

This chapter discusses work that needs to be done and open issues.

\section{Pending work}

This section describes work that should be done soon because it is
needed for completeness or to simplify writing code:
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Function pointers: the \keyword{where} clauses must become part of the signature
  of the function.  In addition, we need to define the 
  rules for conversion of function pointers.
\item The definition of \arrayviewT\ needs to be extended to include
      relative alignment.
\item For structures, add wording that allows a single statement  
to update a variable member whose member bounds is expected to hold after
the statement.  Also add wording to allow a bundle block to do this.
\end{itemize}

\section{Language and library features to be addressed}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Decide what to do about null terminated arrays. Do we have special rules
  for them?
\item
  Old-style function declarations where argument list length or
  parameter/argument types could be mismatched at compile time, leading
  to undefined behavior.
\item
  Variable arguments
\item
  Pointer casts that produce incorrectly aligned pointers have undefined
  behavior, according to the C11 standard. This hole should be filled in
  for safe pointer types. For safe pointer types, we should specify
  either (1) dereferencing an incorrectly aligned pointer shall cause a
  runtime error or (2) the cast itself shall check any alignment
  requirements. For case 1, note that safe pointer arithmetic is already
  defined to preserve misalignment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Concrete syntax}
 
The current syntax for describing post-conditions places a \keyword{where}
clause after the function parameter list declaration:

\begin{verbatim}
f( ...)
where cond1 ...
\end{verbatim}

This syntax might lead to confusion. We might want to adopt an alternate
syntax that makes this clearer. Some suggestions are the keywords
\texttt{on\_return} or \texttt{after}:

\begin{verbatim}
f(...)
on_return cond1 ...

f(...)
after cond1 ...
\end{verbatim}

Section~\ref{section:alternate-pointer-type-syntax} describes alternate
syntax proposals for pointer types.

\section{Further out work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow conditional bounds expressions.   While conditional
expressions are allowed in the non-modifying expressions in a bounds expression, 
there is not a conditional form of bounds expressions.  This is useful for
specifying that an expression only has bounds if some condition is true.
This could be provided by adding a clause to bounds-exp that uses the
same syntax as C conditional expressions:
\begin{tabbing}
\var{bounds}\=\var{-exp:} \\
\>\texttt{\var{non-modifying-exp} ? \var{bounds-exp} : \var{bounds-exp}}
\end{tabbing}

We would need to add descriptions of introduction and elimination
forms, as well as enhance the rules for checking the validity of bounds.

\item Allow bounds declarations to declare bounds for expressions.
This would allow the system to easily support tagged null pointers.
The bounds for the untagged pointer would be described. 
A tagged pointer could not be used to access memory.  It would have to be
untagged first  to have valid bounds.
\end{itemize}
